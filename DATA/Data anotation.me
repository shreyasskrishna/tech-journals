Data Annotation 🏷️📊
Data annotation is the process of labeling raw data (text, images, audio, or video) to make it understandable for AI/ML models. 🤖 This labeled data helps machines learn patterns, recognize objects, and make accurate decisions.

Types of Data Annotation
Text Annotation 📝 – Labeling words, entities, sentiment, or intent.
Image Annotation 🖼️ – Bounding boxes, segmentation, and object recognition.
Video Annotation 🎥 – Frame-by-frame tracking of objects and actions.
Audio Annotation 🎧 – Speech recognition, speaker identification, and sentiment analysis.
How It Works
Annotation can be done manually 🖊️ (by humans), semi-automatically ⚙️ (AI-assisted), or fully automated 🤖 (AI-powered).

Applications
Self-driving Cars 🚗 – Identifying pedestrians, lanes, and obstacles.
Healthcare 🏥 – Detecting diseases in medical scans.
Chatbots & Voice Assistants 💬 – Understanding human language.
E-commerce & Recommendations 🛒 – Personalized shopping experiences.
Accurate data annotation is crucial for building high-performing AI systems! 🚀
